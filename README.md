# Horiseon refactor

## Refactor a page for accessibility

[Deployed Link](https://lshillman.github.io/horiseon-refactor/)

Imaginary scenario: Horiseon is a small SEO and marketing agency. They recently determined that their Google page rank was lower than they'd like due to their home page's lack of accessible and semantic elements. They brought me in to clean things up and boost their SEO without changing the UX of their page.

I mainly replaced non-semantic divs with their semantic equivalents. Along the way I combined a lot of redundant CSS styles and changed some image implementations to be nicer to screen readers.

## Technologies used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Git


## Example of semantic code
